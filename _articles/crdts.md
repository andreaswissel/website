I'm writing a series of posts on Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types.
The series is still a work in progress, but I'll post new episodes as I'm finishing them.
Here's the list of all posts that I've published so far:

1. [Preliminaries](/topics/crdt/01-intro)
2. [Algebras & contracts](/topics/crdt/02-contracts)
3. [Lattices](/topics/crdt/03-lattices)
4. [Combinators](/topics/crdt/04-combinators)
5. [Tombstones](/topics/crdt/05-tombstones)

{% include topics/crdt/ack.html %}
