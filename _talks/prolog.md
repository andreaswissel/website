title: Programmation en Logique
abstract: |
  Prolog is one of the most underrated programming languages around; possibly because of its strange syntax and the unusual paradigm.
  But it is a very nice special-purpose programming language.
  In this talk, I introduce Prolog’s programming model, showcase some programming domains in which Prolog allows for very concise, elegant programs, and finally describe how it can also be used as a general-purpose tool.
